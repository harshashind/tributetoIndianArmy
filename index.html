                “The veterans of our military services have put their lives on the line to protect the freedoms that we
                enjoy. <br>They have dedicated their lives to their country and deserve to be recognized for their
                commitment.”<br> <strong style=" text-align: center;">-Judd Gregg</strong>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Love for our mother India creates the firm base of the Indian army. He
                sacrifices his life for the
                protection of the nation’s pride. Every soldier is a true patriot and is always ready to lay down his
                life
                in the service of motherland. Our nation’s protection and safety are totally dependent on our soldiers.

                Indian Army not only fights in the war but also take care of the rescue operations when natural
                calamities
                occur like cyclones, earth-quakes. We must feel the pain of the great sacrifice which our Indian Army is
                doing every day to keeping our country, our people together and safe. Thus, we all salute our Indian
                heroes
                and pay homage to the supreme sacrifice which our army brothers are doing every day.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;"> Being an Indian army officer, one is meant to subsume
                their persona under a
                very demanding but explicit code which states that, <strong>“THE SAFETY, HONOUR AND WELFARE OF YOUR
                    COUNTRY
                    COME FIRST, ALWAYS AND EVERY TIME. THE HONOUR, WELFARE AND COMFORT OF THE MEN YOU COMMAND COME NEXT.
                    YOUR OWN EASE, COMFORT AND SAFETY COME LAST, ALWAYS AND EVERY TIME.”</strong> For them, their
                service to
                the country is more important than anything else. They are undoubtedly the real superheroes of our
                nation.
